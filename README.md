# Quest-Game-Selenium

Quest-Game-Selenium is an automated test suite designed to verify the end-to-end functionality of the Quest Game application using Selenium WebDriver. This project showcases acceptance testing, UI interaction, and automated regression for the Quest Game web application.

The suite covers critical user flows, simulates real player actions, and validates key features to ensure a reliable gaming experience.

## Key Features

* Automated UI Testing for Core Game Flows
* Cross-Browser Compatibility Checks
* Scenario-Based Acceptance Tests
* Integration with Continuous Integration Tools

## Skills Learned

### Iterative Development
* **Hotseat Approach**: Developed tests that simulate real multi-user scenarios, ensuring the game logic holds in shared or sequential play environments.
* **Web-Based Automation**: Transitioned from manual to fully automated testing, demonstrating adaptability and code maintainability.

### Acceptance Testing
* **Scenario Path Identification**: Mapped out and automated full user journeys through the Quest Game, emphasizing critical acceptance criteria.

### UI Automation and Design
* **Decoupling Test Logic and Data**: Architected tests to separate scenario data from automation logic, enabling easier updates and scenario expansion.
* **Robust Locator Strategies**: Implemented maintainable element locators and validation strategies to withstand UI changes.

### Refactoring
* **Code Improvement**: Regularly improved test structure, removed duplication, and enhanced readability.
* **Commit Management**: Used REFAC commits to clearly indicate improvements and refactorings.

### Project Management
* **Repository Organization**: Structured the test repository with clear directory layouts, naming conventions, and descriptive commit messages.

## Setup and Run

1.  Clone the repository:  
    `git clone https://github.com/cupcakequeen77777/Quest-Game-Selenium.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory:  
    `cd Quest-Game-Selenium`
3.  Install dependencies (Node.js and npm required):  
    `npm install`
4.  Configure Selenium WebDriver and browser drivers as needed.
5.  Run the test suite:  
    `npm test`

### Example/Demo

To see the automated tests in action, run the suite using `npm test`. The tests will launch the browser, execute user flows, and display results in the console or in the generated reports.

### Testing Instructions

1.  Ensure all dependencies are installed:  
    `npm install`
2.  Execute the test suite:  
    `npm test`
3.  Review test results in the console output or in the generated HTML/XML reports (if configured).
